# Aion-classic-skin-mods

1. Follow the pathway: aionclassic\l10n\ENG\data

2. Create a custompreset folder

3. Drop your .pak files in the folder and launch the game

4. Use a plastic surgery ticket or create new character to apply changes

5. Enjoy



WARNING

Do not use tanned.pak & the zip file together as they overlap ( I would recommend to not use the tanned.pak file at all, it is more for a record keeping for me )

The changes you make to your character are visible to every player.

Last updated on 12/03/2024: Male presets 13 to 17 added (red skin tones); Female presets 32, 41 to 43 added (red skin tones)
