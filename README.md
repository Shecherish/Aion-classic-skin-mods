            Asmo Skin Mod

1. Follow the pathway: aionclassic\l10n\ENG\data

2. Create a custompreset folder

3. Drop your .pak files in the folder and launch the game

4. Use a plastic surgery ticket or create new character to apply changes

5. Enjoy



WARNING

Do not use tanned.pak & the zip file together as they overlap ( I would recommend to not use the tanned.pak file at all, it is more for a record keeping for me )

The changes you make to your character are visible to every player.

Last updated on 12/03/2024: Male presets 13 to 17 added (red skin tones); Female presets 32, 41 to 43 added (red skin tones)


            No Yell Please Mod

A cure for the oldest Aion EU problem. You're an oldschool player who uses a vanilla english client, but all your cute female friends use KR voicepacks and hammer you down with a deafening 'hiyaaa'? Fear no more. Your solution is here.

1. Works for Aion (ENG) version. Replaces Female 4 (Young) attack sounds with Female 1 (Basic) sounds.
   
2. Head into L10N->ENG->sounds->voice->attack and replace attack.pak with the downloaded file.


            NO MANE MOD

Asmo female no mane mod is ready for classic 3.0 (brawler patch). Asmo male side of it is a work in progress! Only you can see the changes.

1. Go to aionclassic\data\pc
2. Replace the pc.pak with my version
3. Enjoy

This mod will need to be updated for major updates so dont worry if it suddenly stops working.
I may have missed one or two armours - you can drop me a message with armour name/armour class and I will try to update.
