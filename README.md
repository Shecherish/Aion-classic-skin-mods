            Asmo Skin Mod

1. Follow the pathway: aionclassic\l10n\ENG\data

2. Create a custompreset folder

3. Drop your .pak files in the folder and launch the game

4. Use a plastic surgery ticket or create new character to apply changes

5. Enjoy



WARNING

Do not use tanned.pak & the zip file together as they overlap ( I would recommend to not use the tanned.pak file at all, it is more for a record keeping for me )

The changes you make to your character are visible to every player.

Last updated on 12/03/2024: Male presets 13 to 17 added (red skin tones); Female presets 32, 41 to 43 added (red skin tones)


            No Yell Please Mod

A cure for the oldest Aion EU problem. You're an oldschool player who uses a vanilla english client, but all your cute female friends use KR voicepacks and hammer you down with a deafening 'hiyaaa'? Fear no more. Your solution is here.

1. Works for Aion (ENG) version. Replaces Female 4 (Young) attack sounds with Female 1 (Basic) sounds.
   
2. Head into L10N->ENG->sounds->voice->attack and replace attack.pak with the downloaded file.


            NO MANE MOD
